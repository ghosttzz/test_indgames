Resume:In this project I show a little about the automation I use, with a TypeScript file saving the HTML locations, and how it is divided into timeouts.


#General Questions
1. What is the primary purpose of Quality Assurance (QA)?
R: It is the best quality delivery and the one that most closely correlates with what the end user (Customer) wants, being within the requirements of the system itself and the customer

2. What is the difference between a test case and a test plan?
R: It's the difference in tests that are a little more micro or macro. Test case is a set of actions to verify a system functionality. The test plan, on the other hand, is more bureaucratic and broad, bringing approaches, resources and schedules to the test cases

3. What does the term 'regression testing' refer to?
R: It refers to the tests that go through the entire application, testing the main functionalities of the application.
4. How would you create a template to describe bugs on a software that is being constantly
released?
R:It would limit by functionality such as EndPoint, integrations with other products, registrations or reports, after which it would again limit the criticality and speed of adjustment. This way you would have more ways to measure how long it would take or whether or not it is worth fixing the bug now

5. What is the importance of test automation in QA? What would you explore in terms of
automation for games being developed in a short period of time?
R:Automated testing has raised the quality of a product/software to a very high level, bringing greater reliability to deliveries and being able to explore more and more scenarios that were not previously tested. I believe that as they are web games, it would be easy to automate using Cypress, as it works for different browsers. And limiting some of the most used routines first would help automate the main points

6. Describe the main stages of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
R:Analyze the requirements, which is when you validate whether or not this improvement actually enters the system, whether or not it makes sense. With this, during refinement you mentally plan the tests you will do, taking into account time and effort. After that, he develops these test cases in writing, then configures the environment and executes them. Thus bringing a very positive organization to the testing cycle

7. How would you handle a situation where a bug you reported is marked as 'not
reproducible' by the development team?
R: After validation with the development team, I would validate by bringing the information that was in the system at that time to the testing environment, to try to be as faithful as possible to what the client faced. I believe that every Bug is reproducible, so I would try some ways, such as slowing down the system, registering something wrong or something like that.


#General Overview:
1. Even though this is not a question, weâ€™d like to hear why you selected this game. I liked the way the game is in terms of visuals, also bringing a little Dia de los muertos culture. I found the chuby style very interesting.
2. What are the ups and downs?I wouldn't say it has a bass, I'm not used to playing casinos or anything like that. The game is very intuitive and assertive
3. What would you consider a factor that would make you play again? the loading screen doesn't take as long, and it looks very accessible
4. Was this an engaging experience? Yes, of course, even though it is not necessarily a practical automation test, it is still necessary to ensure that the QA has knowledge and experience about test cases and how to test
